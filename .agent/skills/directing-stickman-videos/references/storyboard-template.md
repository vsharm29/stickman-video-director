# Director's Proposal Contract

Use this contract for Phase A. Present a readable production proposal and stop for confirmation before writing model prompts. Refer to `references/style-catalog.md` for style specifications.

## Rewrite the source

Create one natural English narration scaled to approximately 20–25 words per 10-second clip based on the target duration (e.g. ~60–75 words for 30s, ~120–150 words for 60s default, ~360–450 words for 3min, ~600–750 words for 5min).

- Preserve the source's core claim, names, numbers, and factual meaning.
- Strengthen a weak opening with an immediate hook.
- Remove repetition and secondary branches from long sources.
- Expand short sources with a relevant example, progression, reframe, or callback.
- Prefer clear spoken English to literal translation.
- Simplify wording before increasing speaking speed.
- Do not invent research, statistics, quotations, product claims, or factual details.

Use the user's language for planning explanations. Keep the voiceover in English and give a reference translation in the user's language.

## Header contract

Present these items in order:

1. English title and reference-language title
2. Core message and opening hook
3. Chosen aspect ratio (`16:9` or `9:16`), target duration (in 10s multiples), and visual style/theme (Style 1 Classic Light/Dark, Style 2A Modern Studio Tech, or Style 2B Cinematic Story)
4. Narrator identity, speaking pace, English word count, and estimated duration
5. Up to three saturated accent colors (for Style 1) or visual palette/environment mood (for Style 2), named in ordinary language, and what each represents
6. BGM direction, emotional turn, tone, and narrative arc

Default the narrator only after required setup is complete: a bright, energetic adult female voice (or warm young adult American male voice) speaking natural American English. Infer tone and palette from the source when the user did not specify them.

## Narrative patterns: High-Completion 5-Stage Heartbeat Engine

To break through the 60%+ video completion rate threshold, structure every script through this emotional heartbeat progression:

1. **Stage 1: Golden Hook (黄金钩子)**
   - **Timing**: Flexible based on duration (in short 30s/60s videos, delivered rapidly within the first 2–5 seconds / `[0–3s]` of Clip 1; in 3–5min videos, establishes the premise across the first 5–15 seconds).
   - **Goal**: Ask an unexpected, counter-intuitive question or present a striking visual paradox that instantly creates an irresistible information gap. Never open with slow throat-clearing.
2. **Stage 2: Disrupting Assumptions (打破常识)**
   - **Goal**: Articulate the common belief or conventional wisdom that everyone assumes to be true, then shatter it in a single decisive sentence to create cognitive conflict and suspense.
3. **Stage 3: Unveiling Insider Secrets (拉出内幕)**
   - **Goal**: Pull back the curtain on a little-known technical mechanism, hidden friction, or systemic secret that keeps the audience captivated and curious.
4. **Stage 4: Ultimate Truth Revelation (真相揭秘)**
   - **Goal**: Deliver the underlying business logic, scientific mechanism, or human psychological truth with complete clarity. Give the audience the satisfying "aha!" breakthrough.
5. **Stage 5: Elevation & High-Engagement Discussion (升华互动)**
   - **Goal**: Crystallize the takeaway into a memorable punchline, and finish with a provocative, open-ended discussion question that compels viewers to take sides and debate in the comments.

### Dynamic Clip Allocation by Duration ($N = \text{duration} / 10$)

- **30s (3 clips)**:
  - Clip 1: Lightning hook (0–3s) → Establish conflict
  - Clip 2: Unveil hidden reality & mechanics
  - Clip 3: Ultimate truth + Comment-debate prompt
- **60s (6 clips, default)**:
  - Clip 1: Golden Hook (counter-intuitive question) → Premise
  - Clip 2: Disrupt Assumptions (shatter conventional wisdom)
  - Clip 3: Unveil Insider Secrets (hidden friction)
  - Clips 4–5: Mechanism & Ultimate Truth (cognitive satisfaction)
  - Clip 6: Elevation punchline + Irresistible comment question
- **90s (9 clips)**:
  - Clip 1: Golden Hook
  - Clips 2–3: Disrupt Assumptions
  - Clips 4–6: Unveil Insider Secrets
  - Clips 7–8: Ultimate Truth Revelation
  - Clip 9: Elevation & Comment Discussion
- **180s+ (3–5 min)**:
  - Hook (Clip 1) → Assumptions (15–20%) → Insider Secrets (35–40%) → Ultimate Truth (30–35%) → Elevation & Discussion (final 1–2 clips)

## Storyboard contract

Produce exactly N approximately ten-second rows (where N = target duration in seconds / 10; default: 6 rows for 60s):

| Time | Narrative purpose | Stick-figure scene | Motion, camera, and transition | English VO | Reference translation | BGM / SFX |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Give each row a different narrative job aligned with the 5-stage engine. Allocate approximately 18–25 English words per row while keeping sentence boundaries natural.

## Visual-density recipe

Build every row from three sequential beats:

- `0–3s`: establish or inherit the visual premise.
- `3–7s`: transform, escalate, or explain the metaphor through physical character actions.
- `7–10s`: deliver a climax and create the next transition.

Use at least four relevant devices per row:

- expressive stick-figure action (running, jumping, touching glass, drawing lines)
- environmental transformation
- concrete visual metaphor
- diagram, arrow, or icon-only symbol
- particles, energy, fluid, explosion, or light
- camera push, pull, pan, orbit, shake, or tracking move
- foreground wipe or object crossing the lens
- match cut, shape morph, or motion-matched transition
- interaction with another figure or oversized object

Require a perceptible visual change every two to three seconds. Make every effect clarify or intensify the spoken idea; omit unrelated spectacle. Avoid abstract liquid morphing.

## Palette and text

Keep the background and stick figure monochrome according to the selected theme (for Style 1), or use high-key studio grid / cinematic lighting (for Style 2). Use no more than three saturated accent colors across the video. Assign semantic meaning such as anxiety, danger, energy, discovery, or success.

Name colors only with ordinary descriptive language. Do not use hexadecimal, RGB, HSL, Pantone, or other technical color notation anywhere in the proposal or production prompts.

Default the generated video to no visible words, letters, numbers, captions, subtitles, interface copy, or technical annotations. Make message bubbles, content cards, meters, clocks, and notifications icon-only. After the storyboard, optionally list concise two-to-five-word English overlays for post-production, including their target clips and safe placement; never carry those overlays into the video-generation prompts.

## Composition by aspect ratio

- `16:9`: use left-center-right staging, lateral tracking, horizontal match cuts, and deliberate negative space. Reserve clean space for optional post-production overlays when useful.
- `9:16`: use foreground/background depth, vertical reveals, stacked motion, foreground passes, and interface-safe overlay space.

Changing ratio requires new staging, camera paths, transition geometry, and overlay-safe negative space. Changing theme or style requires updated color balance and contrast checks.

## Continuity

End each row with a visible interface that the next row inherits: a pose, moving object, filled frame, travel direction, shape, or camera motion. Name both sides of every connection in the proposal.

## Confirmation ending

End Phase A by asking the user to:

- approve the current proposal and generate the N Omni Flash prompts;
- revise a named scene or narration passage; or
- change a global setting such as aspect ratio, duration, style, theme, palette, voice, or tone.

Do not include final model prompts. A global change invalidates approval and requires a revised Phase A.

## Phase A checks

- Source, aspect ratio (`16:9` or `9:16`), duration, and style/theme are known.
- Script strictly implements the 5-Stage High-Completion Heartbeat Engine.
- Final clip ends with a provocative, comment-driving discussion prompt.
- English narration matches duration (~20–25 words per 10s clip; ~120–150 words for 60s).
- Exactly N storyboard rows have distinct narrative purposes (N = duration / 10).
- Every row has three beats, at least four visual devices, audio, and a transition.
- Visual change occurs approximately every two to three seconds.
- No more than three saturated accent colors are used (for Style 1) or clean palette rules followed (for Style 2).
- No technical color notation is present.
- Any proposed text is clearly separated as a post-production overlay and absent from generated scenes.
- Every adjacent pair has a named continuity connection.
- The ending returns to the central message and CTA.
- No unsupported factual detail was added.
