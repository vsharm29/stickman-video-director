# Directing Stickman Videos

## Core contract

Turn one source into a confirmed director's proposal and then N standalone prompts for approximately ten-second Gemini Omni Flash clips (where N = target duration in seconds / 10; default 6 clips for 60 seconds). Preserve the source's meaning while structuring it through a high-completion 5-stage emotional narrative arc.

## Setup gate

Require these before planning:

- source material
- aspect ratio: `16:9` or `9:16`
- target duration: in multiples of 10 seconds (e.g. `30s`, `60s`, `90s`, `3min`, `5min`; default: `60s` / 6 clips if unspecified)
- visual style and theme:
  - `Style 1 (Classic Minimalist)`: light (white background, black figure) or dark (black background, white figure)
  - `Style 2 (Modern Beanie Zeke)`:
    - `Style 2A (Modern Studio Tech)`: pure white high-key studio, subtle light-gray perspective grid, floating cyan/blue glass UI
    - `Style 2B (Cinematic Story)`: full-color narrative environments, cinematic lighting & depth

If aspect ratio or visual style is missing, ask for all missing items in one concise message and stop. If duration is omitted, default to 60 seconds (6 clips). If a user provides a duration not divisible by 10, round to the nearest 10-second multiple. If a user specifies only light or dark theme, default to Style 1. Never select an aspect ratio or style silently. Do not re-ask choices already supplied.

Urgency, generation cost, client pressure, and requests to "pick normal settings" do not waive this gate.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/storyboard-template.md` and `references/style-catalog.md`. Structure the narrative using the **5-Stage High-Completion Heartbeat Engine** (Golden Hook → Disrupting Assumptions → Unveiling Insider Secrets → Ultimate Truth Revelation → Elevation & Interactive Discussion), with timing dynamically scaled to the target duration. Produce Phase A in the user's language, with English VO and a reference translation.
2. Stop after the director's proposal and request explicit approval.
3. If the user changes ratio, duration, style, theme, narration, scene structure, or global direction, recompose Phase A and request approval again.
4. Only after approval of the current Phase A, read `references/omni-flash-prompt-contract.md` and produce Phase B.
5. Use `references/examples.md` only when a concrete end-to-end example would resolve ambiguity.

Topic approval, schedule pressure, or approval of an older draft is not approval of the current Phase A.

## Output rules

- Structure every script using the 5-stage high-completion flow:
  1. **Golden Hook**: Instant curiosity trigger via a counter-intuitive question or visual paradox. Timing is flexible based on duration (e.g. within the first 2–5 seconds in short videos, up to 10–15s in long videos); never open with generic platitudes.
  2. **Disrupting Assumptions**: State what everyone thinks is true, then shatter it in one sentence to build cognitive conflict.
  3. **Unveiling Insider Secrets**: Pull back the curtain on hidden mechanics, counter-intuitive details, or the real obstacle.
  4. **Ultimate Truth Revelation**: Deliver the underlying business logic or human psychology truth with maximum cognitive payoff.
  5. **Elevation & High-Engagement Discussion**: Conclude with a memorable punchline and an irresistible discussion prompt that sparks debate in the comments.
- Scale English VO word count to approximately 20–25 words per 10-second clip across N clips (e.g. ~60–75 words for 30s / 3 clips, ~120–150 words for 60s / 6 clips, ~360–450 words for 3min / 18 clips, ~600–750 words for 5min / 30 clips).
- Give each clip three timed beats, at least four relevant visual devices, and a visual change every two to three seconds.
- Keep character proportions, line weight, style, and narrator consistent across all clips.
- For Style 1, limit the video to three saturated accent colors named with ordinary descriptive words (e.g. vivid red, electric blue, warm gold). For light theme, enforce a flat, digitally pure-white canvas with no textures, gradients, or 3D depth.
- For Style 2 (Modern Beanie Zeke), enforce character consistency:
  - Clip 1: `A minimalist 2D animated stick figure wearing a bright red beanie (smooth knit, no pom-pom) and a yellow t-shirt, with simple black stick limbs and shorts. Simple black lines, vibrant colors, smooth 2D animation style.`
  - Clips 2–N: `The same minimalist 2D animated stick figure in a bright red beanie and yellow shirt... Simple black lines, vibrant colors, smooth 2D animation style.`
  - No detailed eyes, pupils, or photorealistic features (avoids bug-eye deformation).
- For Style 2A (Modern Studio Tech), enforce: `in a modern bright white studio space with subtle light-gray perspective grid lines on the floor plane. High-key studio lighting, clean white negative space, sleek glowing cyan and electric blue glass holographic UI elements.` Always include negative constraint: `STRICTLY MINIMALIST, NO CIRCUIT BOARD TEXTURES, NO SCI-FI WALL PANELS, NO CRACKED CONCRETE.`
- For Style 2B (Cinematic Story), specify full-color narrative setting and cinematic lighting while preserving the 2D animated stick-figure character design.
- For all styles, avoid abstract liquid/shape morphing. Drive motion with concrete character actions (leaping, touching glass, drawing luminous lines, opening doors) with timed beats across `[0–3s]`, `[3–7s]`, and `[7–10s]`. Never leave the character idle.
- Lock narrator voice description verbatim across all clips. Mandate BGM continuity from clip 1.
- Treat narration as audio-only (`Audio voiceover only, strictly no speech bubbles, no dialogue boxes`). Quote exact dialogue and forbid alteration, repetition, captions, subtitles, or visual transcription.
- Never place technical color notation (hex, RGB, Pantone) inside generation prompts.
- Default generated clips to no visible words, letters, numbers, or interface copy. Put optional two-to-five-word overlays in a separate post-production note.
- Match every clip ending to the next clip opening.
- Do not invent unsupported facts, statistics, quotations, or product claims.

## Revision rules

Recompose rather than rename:

- `16:9`: stage action across left, center, and right; use lateral tracking and negative space.
- `9:16`: use depth, stacked motion, vertical reveals, and interface-safe placement.

Theme, ratio, duration, or style changes require a fresh visual balance check. A global change invalidates prior approval.

## Final check

Apply the checklist in the loaded reference. Repair any failed condition before responding.
